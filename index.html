<h2 class='ace'><b>Personal Information</b></h2>
<p class='normal'>Born and raised in Victoria, I am a first-year currently studying Information Technology and I hope to go on to complete a master’s degree in Cyber Security. I completed high school in 2018 and was also a student studying Paramedicine at Victoria University in 2019. My main hobbies would be including exercise and reading.</p>
<h2 class='ace'><b>Interest in IT</b></h2>
<p class='normal'>My interest in IT stems from practicality, technology holds a prevalent place within our society and that is only increasing, therefore choosing a career in IT seems particularly rewarding. This industry is also quite versatile, not only in terms of the roles and positions available but also regarding how these jobs can be performed. Coronavirus has had a devasting effect on our society that we are still reeling from, one such effect was on our economy, causing many to lose their jobs or experience a significant cut to their income. However, in comparison to other industries, the IT industry was largely unhindered and even flourished in some cases such as a significant boom in online shopping. This example only demonstrates the level of job security that IT positions can have and will continue to have. Even putting this aside, I have long since been an avid fan of video games and electronic media thanks to my father who works as a software architect, both of which have helped serve as a gateway into the world of IT.</p>
<p class='normal'>I chose to study at RMIT due to its accessibility and a positive reputation regarding technology. In terms of location, RMIT’s city campus was one of the best if not the best choices for university given my location. RMIT’s usage of online classes was also an influence as online learning is an effective method for me to learn.</p>
<p class='normal'>I expect to learn a diverse set of skills and theory that will allow me to become competent in several areas such as programming and security. However, above all else, I expect to develop the necessary skills and abilities to transition into a master’s degree of Cyber Security.</p>
<h2 class='ace'><b>Ideal Job</b></h2>
<h2 class='ace'><b>Freelance Penetration Tester</b></h2>

<p class='usual'>An example of a job undertaken by a Freelance Penetration Tester</p>
<p class='normal'><b>Description:</b> Penetration testers are ethical hackers that conduct security or pen tests to breach networks and identify weaknesses within these systems. In comparison, a freelance penetration tester has the option of working alone and chooses which jobs they undertake. This latter career appeals to me as I would not only prefer to work alone but also earn a profit on my own terms free from constricting authority. Freedom is a very important aspect, not only in terms of movement and location, being able to work from anywhere in the world but also being free from authority figures. Flexibility is also an extremely important aspect as well as I would prefer to work my own hours, that being said I am willing to forego flexibility at least temporarily when it comes to current projects.</p>
<p class='normal'><b>Skills Possessed:</b></p>
<ul class='normal'>
<li>Basic knowledge of programs and languages such as Python, Git, and HTML</li>
<li>Lifesaving Qualifications such as Bronze Medallion, Advanced Resuscitation Techniques (ART), Inflatable Rescue Crew (IRB) Driver and Crew</li>
<li>iTFE qualifications such as Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA), Waiter, Barista, and First Aid</li>
<li>Experience and knowledge in construction and meat industries thanks to employment history</li>
</ul>
<p class='normal'><b>Necessary Skills:</b></p>
<ul class='normal'>
<li>Advanced knowledge and experience in concepts such as cryptography, scripting, coding, programming with particular emphasis on computer and information security</li>
<li>Advanced knowledge and experience with languages such as Python, operating systems such as Windows, and networking and network protocols such as TCP/IP </li>
<li>Strong communication skills </li>
<li>Desire to learn </li>
</ul>
<p class='normal'><b>Learning Plan:</b> I intend on completing my Information Technology degree and going on to complete a master’s degree in Cyber Security. I intend on tailoring my courses within my initial degree with this master’s degree in mind, pursuing skills that will be necessary and helpful within not only this master’s degree but the Cyber Security industry as a whole. I intend to learn any skills I might deem helpful that are outside the scope of these degrees as well as refining and developing the necessary skills to achieve my desired job. </p>

<h2 class='ace'><b>Personality Profile</b></h2>
<h2 class='ace'><b>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</b></h2>
<div style='text-align: center; position:relative; left: 0px'><img src='16Personalities.jpg' width="400" /></div>
<p class='normal'><b>Strengths:</b> I tend to excel in analysis and abstract thinking due to a large focus on pragmatism as well as logic and reasoning. As such I hold objectivity in high regard but am still grounded and open-minded. I tend to be rather straightforward, almost to the point of being blunt as I believe that it’s generally illogical to be indirect. </p>
<p class='normal'><b>Weaknesses:</b> My honest nature can very easily lead me to being perceived as cold or apathetic, which while not entirely incorrect, isn’t completely truthful either. I can be remarkably absent-minded when something captures my interest, leading me to become forgetful or even clumsy. While I am capable of working in a team, I am an individualist first and foremost and tend to cooperate in the loosest or most minimalistic sense possible. I value my freedom above all else, as such I tend to ignore all rules and guidelines placed on me even if it’s in my best interest to follow them which can easily bring me into conflict. Another issue stemming from this is that my abilities can be inhibited if constricted by authority. Finally, I tend to second guess myself frequently regarding concepts such as intelligence but also decision-making, especially if forced to make a hasty decision with minimal reflection. </p>
<p class='normal'><b>Team Composition</b> As stated before I am more than capable of functioning in a team and am willing to if necessary. I am versatile and flexible regarding the roles I can play but prefer a pseudo-leadership role where I take initiative and direct a project but treat everyone as equals, adopt the input of others, and allow other members of my team to perform their tasks without stifling them as an overbearing authority figure. While I am unwilling to act as a subordinate, I am willing to cooperate all the same. While I would prefer to work with like-minded individuals, I am rather unbiased when it comes to the individuals that I work with as I can easily adjust.</p>
<h2 class='ace'><b>Learning Styles</b></h2>
<div style='text-align: center; position:relative; left: 0px'><img src='Learning Style.jpg' width="400" /></div>
<p class='normal'><b>Pragmatist Style:</b> Generally, I prefer for the content I am learning to be demonstrated practically and for every activity to have a significant purpose so that I don’t feel as if I am wasting my time. Learning methods that would adhere to this style would include but are not limited to; practicals; discussions; problem setting; and case studies.</p>
<p class='normal'><b>Reflector Style:</b> Another approach that I am comfortable with is simple observation, collecting and analysing information at my leisure. Although this may seem contradictory to the pragmatist style, this could be attributed to my preferred learning styles shifting and changing based on something as simple as my current mood. Such methods would include but are not limited to; showcase/demonstrations; feedback; coaching; questionaries/quizzes; breaks in which to reflect; and discussions. </p>
<h2 class='ace'><b>USC Leadership Style</b></h2>
<div style='text-align: center; position:relative; left: 0px'><img src='Leader.jpg' width="300" /></div>
<p class='normal'><b>Contrarian Leader:</b> I tend to be unbiased or even unopinionated to some extent due to containing multiple perspectives and ideas within my mind, many of which can be conflicting. I will hold off on decision-making in favour of further analysis and am willing to delegate.</p>
<br></br>
<p class='normal'>While these results more or less confirmed my personal self-assessment, they are rather insignificant at a personal level as I have long since possessed a strong understanding of myself, not to mention that these results could be subject to concepts such as the Barnum effect, a phenomenon where individuals mistakenly believe that a set of generalised results apply specifically to them. Putting this aside, these results can be useful for an individual that desires to gain a basic understanding of myself and is relevant in that context.</p>
<p class='normal'>While I have no intention of changing the way I interact with others in a team thanks to these results as I will interact however I feel is appropriate, these results at the very least help bring awareness to my strengths and shortcomings which can help me refine and enhance my interactions with team members.</p>
<p class='normal'>The best-case scenario when forming a team is finding like-minded individuals, however, this will not always be possible, and as such, I am willing to work with any individual. Even in the case of being unable to cooperate with an individual or function within a team as a whole, I will still work towards the set goal, even as an individual if I must.  </p>

<br></br>
<h2 class='ace'>Project Idea</h2>
<p class='normal'><b>Overview:</b> My project idea will be involving Minecraft as a model to simulate a creation. This project will more than likely involve creating infrastructure or redesigning existing infrastructure that could be implemented in the real world in the same vein as the United Nations Block by Block project which has redesigned several real-life areas such as Hanoi for the benefit of its female residents. This project can be undertaken from a global to a suburban level, although the difficulty and feasibility of which will depend on the level at which the project is being undertaken. </p>
<p class='normal'><b>Motivation:</b> First and foremost, this type of project has the potential for real-world change which has been demonstrated by the Block-by-Block project, uniting residents from various areas to make changes that they deem viable. This project has the potential to make local changes and yield direct benefits, whether that be at a country, state, or suburban level. Minecraft in particular is a game that I have significant experience with, having been playing since 2011. Building within this game is something that I have devoted a significant portion of time to, and as such, I lack no shortage of experience to draw upon to create change. </p>
<p class='normal'><b>Description:</b> As indicated my project will likely take place at a state level at the very least as to (hypothetically) invoke a tangible and direct effect. When examining local councils and the projects they continuously undertake, it can be observed that there is no shortage of ideas or improvements that could be made to a local community. However, this project does not have to be limited to Australia and can be directed to anywhere in the world, whether it be locations that require genuine change or well-established locations that could be further refined. The final location will ultimately be determined by not only what locations would warrant such a project but also input from the team that I would be inevitably be working with. Conducting said project will require significant research not only in regards to where said project should take place but also what changes could be and how they could be made. This research could be conducted all remotely but could incorporate in-person research through methods such as interviews if so desired. An invaluable resource for developing this project will be Google Maps which allows detailed images of a potential environment to be easily accessed and used as reference material. The project will in all likelihood require a dedicated server to construct the conceptual project, this will not only allow a collaborative effort, increasing the amount of progress that can be made but also allows for more immediate changes. The main two options would include setting up a personal server or renting/creating a pre-existing dedicated server. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages but a personal server will more than likely be the best option due to the relative ease that you can create a server with the only main drawback being that the server cannot realistically be active 24/7 due to potential strain on the host’s system. In comparison, a dedicated server would be in all likelihood available more frequently but at a cost. In the same vein hardware capable of running such a model is necessary but is relatively easy to overcome as most modern devices are capable of running Minecraft or an equivalent model. A communication app such as Discord or Messenger will be essential for communication and transferral of information between team members and can take the form of other apps such as Microsoft Teams if necessary. As for which model would be used, Minecraft will most likely be the best option due to its built-in “Creative Mode” which allows players to create and destroy without restriction with access to flight and infinite blocks, and the existence of external mods that allow for large-scale terraforming and world manipulation such as WorldEdit. One of the drawbacks is that Minecraft requires a paid account to play although a free trial is available for use. Alternatives could include Terraria or Cube World, but the former also requires you to own the game, and the latter is rather underdeveloped to be used as a model and also requires the game to be owned. </p>
<p class='normal'><b>Tools:</b> The first tool necessary is a model to create said project which would most likely be Minecraft but other alternatives could include Terraria or Cube World. Next would be a device to run said model on, the most optimal device would be a computer or a laptop but Minecraft can be run on mobile devices, although this can make a group effort difficult. An optional and yet rewarding tool would be a server which would allow for a collaborative effort. In the event of collaboration, some communication apps would more than likely be necessary which take the form of several outlets such as phone calls, text messages, or group chats using apps such as Messenger or Discord. </p>
<p class='normal'><b>Required Skills:</b> A basic understanding or level of experience with computing devices and Minecraft would be required to undertake this project, although both of these can be acquired rather quickly. Access to Minecraft or an equivalent model is required as well as a device that is capable of running this model. To organise a group effort, a basic level of communication is necessary, especially if conducted on a global scale. This is also echoed when using outlets such as Discord and Messenger as some experience with these outlets is necessary for effective communication, however, this experience can be gained rather quickly as well. </p>
<p class='normal'><b>Outcome:</b> The end result would be a creation that could be implemented into the real world if so desired, resulting in a tangible product. This project could have a significant impact on the residents of any given area that this creation is implemented and have a direct impact on their lives. </p>
